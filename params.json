{"name":"Virtual-robot","body":"Little chain-of-thoughts\r\n\r\nFirst I watched Jaron Lanier's TEDxSF talk \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSF-Jaron-Lanier-You-Are-Not/player?layout=&read_more=1\" width=\"420\" height=\"331\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nThan I finished Coursera course on machine learning as well as one taught on Caltech \"Learning From Data\". \r\n\r\nJaron Lanier observation was, that after he put persons in virtual reality, watching them by kinect they ware able to control very strange avatars- that is virtual reality persons. Like ones with super big arms or so. \r\n\r\nAndrew Ng led a project that taught a helicopter how to autonomously make very difficult maneuvers by demonstrating them (reinforced learning)\r\n\r\nI hope to put these two ideas together and make a system to teach robotic arms or so by showing them how people in virtual reality use these arms as their own.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
