        <p>Little chain-of-thoughts</p>

<p>First I watched Jaron Lanier's TEDxSF talk </p>



<p>Than I finished Coursera course on machine learning as well as one taught on Caltech "Learning From Data". </p>

<p>Jaron Lanier observation was, that after he put persons in virtual reality, watching them by kinect they ware able to control very strange avatars- that is virtual reality persons. Like ones with super big arms or so. </p>

<p>Andrew Ng led a project that taught a helicopter how to autonomously make very difficult maneuvers by demonstrating them (reinforced learning)</p>

<p>I hope to put these two ideas together and make a system to teach robotic arms or so by showing them how people in virtual reality use these arms as their own.</p>
